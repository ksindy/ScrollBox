# ScrollBox
Scrolling rectangles of various depths and colors

I used two programs in order to accomlish the same task. Each directory has it's own README file. 

Graphics is a more straightforward program but limited in color and movement of objects.

Matplotlib is a bit more complicated but it is much more popular and has a lot of options when it comes to colors, shapes, and movements of the objects.

**Instructions for Running Graphics Python File.** 

* Download and unzip this repository.

* Navigate to repository in your terminal.

~~~
cd ~/Downloads/ScrollBox-master/
~~~

* Run script by typing the following command:

~~~
./run_scroll_box.sh
~~~

* Press control+c to exit program.


**Notes**

You will most likely need to install the graphics module. You can do this by running the following command:

~~~
pip install --user http://bit.ly/csc161graphics
~~~
